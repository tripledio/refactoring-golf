# Refactoring Golf - TakeHomeCalculator

## Hints:

1. You may find that customising your IDE is useful (e.g. custom code templates, or even custom refactorings.)

2. If possible, it would be a good idea to have the two versions (Hole X and Hole X+1) of each set of source files open on different machines, as you could easily tie yourself in knots editing the wrong files!

3. Keep that second machine available as a tooling environment. Writing custom tools (scripts, templates etc) costs you zero points in refactoring golf.

## Course records:
These are the best known scores, achieved using IntelliJ:

| Hole | Best score | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| 1    | 3          |       |
| 2    | 7          |       |
| 3    | 5          |       |
| 4    | 6          |       |
| 5    | 10         |       |
| 6    | 7          |       |
